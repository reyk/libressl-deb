# LibreSSL's libtls for Debian/Ubuntu

> EXPERIMENTAL!!!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reyk/libressl-deb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reyk/libressl-deb)

The [LibreSSL] project provides a free TLS and crypto stack that was
forked from [OpenSSL] in 2014.  The goals are to provide a modernized
codebase, improved security, and to apply best practice development
processes.

[LibreSSL] provides C APIs that are compatible to [OpenSSL]'s [libssl]
and [libcrypto] libraries.  It also provides [libtls], a new TLS
library that is designed to make it easier to write foolproof
applications.

[LibreSSL] conflicts with [OpenSSL] on [Debian] and [Ubuntu] as both
provide the [libssl] and [libcrypto] libraries.  This package only
provides [libtls] as a library, statically linked with the [LibreSSL]
versions of [libssl] and [libcrypto].

This allows to build install programs that use [libtls] without
conflicts.  One example is [OpenBSD]'s TLS-enabled version of
[netcat].

**It packages the [libtls] library but not [libssl] or [libcrypto].**

## Package List

* libtls-dev: LibreSSL libtls headers
* libtls-doc: LibreSSL libtls manual pages
* libtls19: LibreSSL libtls
* netcat-libressl: TCP/IP swiss army knife with TLS support

## Installation

```bash
sudo apt install dpkg-dev devscripts
dpkg-source -x libressl_3.0.2-2.dsc
( cd libressl-3.0.2 && dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign )
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

The `libressl_3.0.2.orig.tar.gz` source file is directly from
[LibreSSL], you can verify it with the official [signify] or [PGP]
public key.  The format of this repository might change in the future,
including the official release tarball here is to simplify the `.deb`
build.

## APT package

Packages are provided on [Debian Salsa] with an inofficial APT
source.  Add the source with the following command:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libressl.list <<EOF
deb [ arch=amd64 allow-insecure=yes ] https://reyk-guest.pages.debian.net/libressl/ autobuilt main
EOF
sudo apt update
```

And install the packages:

```bash
sudo apt install libtls19 libtls-dev libtls-doc netcat-libressl
```

Please note that the packages are not signed at the moment.
